This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 
```{r}
Sept11TSAIR <- ts(Sept11Travel[("Air RPM (000s)")],
               start = c(1990, 1),
               end = c(2004, 4),
               frequency = 12)
Sept11TSRAIL <- ts(Sept11Travel[("Rail PM")],
               start = c(1990, 1),
               end = c(2004, 4),
               frequency = 12)
Sept11TSVMT <- ts(Sept11Travel[("VMT (billions)")],
               start = c(1990, 1),
               end = c(2004, 4),
               frequency = 12)
```

```{r}
plot(Sept11TSAIR)
plot(Sept11TSRAIL)
plot(Sept11TSVMT)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
